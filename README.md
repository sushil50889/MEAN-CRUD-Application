Crud-Operation-Mean-App

This is a simple MEAN app CRUD application project with FORM VALIDATION and full RESPONSIVE Design. I used Routing, FormControl, FormGroup, ngModel, Validators, ReactiveFormsModule and Structural Directives like *ngIf and *ngFor and also FlashMessages. I also use MatDialogModule here for dialog box. For the back-end, I used EXPRESS Framework with MONGOOSE. At the end their is also a image upload section. You can set your profile image, for that i use MULTER.
